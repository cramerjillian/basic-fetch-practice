# Basic Fetch Practice

This page is a simple exercise in using the fetch API to display data.

## Functionality

The fetch requests are triggered by two different buttons:

1) [ Get All Users ]  
    This button displays all users in the database.

2) [ Get All Users Under 10 Years Experience ]  
    This button displays users who have less than 10 years of work experience.

3) [ Reset ]  
    This button clears all displayed data to reset the page.
